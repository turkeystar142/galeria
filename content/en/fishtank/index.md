I spent months watching this online reality tv show. It was live 24/7, and had hilarious encounters. The website was also interactive, because we as audience could send messages and snacks to the contestants. There was also a concept of clans, and when I created a clan it exploded in popularity. We were number one on the leaderboard for almost half of the season. I have fond memories of this show.

There was a dog that approached Luna and I once on a walk. He was so friendly that I thought he was a lost dog, so I let him into my home as I tried to find his owner. Turns out, he was just a stray that needed medical attention. I took him in for a few months until he got strong enough to be adopted by his forever-mom. Luna took such good care of Lucky, as if he were her little brother.
